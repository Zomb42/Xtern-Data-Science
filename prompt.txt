Data Science  

The future of sports is here, and itâ€™s being driven by cutting-edge autonomous vehicle technology. As part of the ongoing innovation in fan engagement, the VeloCityX app has emerged as a powerful platform for enhancing the spectator experience during major racing events. With "Live 360" coverage, interactive fan challenges, and digital merchandise, the app engages fans in real-time and offers new ways to experience the excitement of racing. 

Your mission as part of the Data Science team is to use data to improve fan engagement and provide insights that will drive monetization strategies for VeloCityX. You will explore user interaction data to draw insights on fan behavior and offer recommendations to optimize fan challenges, merchandise sales, and sponsorship integration.

Data Analysis & Cleaning: 

Clean and organize the data into a usable format.

Apply clustering, predictive modeling, or any other relevant techniques to identify key insights about user behavior. 

Visualization: 

Create data visualizations to showcase analysis. 

Deliverables: 

Upload a Jupyter Notebook with your cleaned dataset, analysis, and insights to Github or Google Colab. Provide link to Github or Google Colab.
